## Pronoun sets
### Pull requests
If you are used to github and JSON, add a pull request with a json file in ./assets, following the scheme (using `they/them` for example):
```JSON
{
  "subject": "they",
  "object": "them",
  "pos_adjective": "their",
  "pos_pronoun": "theirs",
  "reflexive": "themselves"
}
```
### Issues
If you're unsure or just hesitant, use an issue and I or someone else should be able to help

## Other contributions
PRs and other contributions are completely welcome, thank you for your effort.
