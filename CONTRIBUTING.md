## Pronoun sets & sentences
### Issues
To add a pronoun set or sentences, just follow the scheme laid out in the issue template for it. 
If you're unsure or just hesitant, open an issue and someone should be able to help.

### Pull Requests
Adding pronouns or sentences through pull requests on the sqlite3 database are less easy to manage, but they're okay if trying to add large quantities of sets and/or sentences at the same time.

## Other contributions
PRs and other contributions are completely welcome, thank you <3
