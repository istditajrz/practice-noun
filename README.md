# practice-noun
A website to practice your or other people's pronouns in specific examples

This is a product of another website I think I remember, but can't find anymore and so wrote my own version :D

**This page is currently not hosted (hopefully changing)**

## Development
### Running
Binary dependencies: npm, python3 (pip)

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the package dependencies for the webpage building using `npm install`
3. Install the package dependencies for the server using `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run using `python3 -m gunicorn -w 4 app:app`

### Contributing
First off, thanks for considering helping and sorry for the absolutely spaghetti code.
#### Sets and sentences
The structure for adding new sets and sentences is an issue, following a template in there.
#### Other contributions
Any criticism, features or improvements are welcome, just add a pull request <3
